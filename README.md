# Modified AMOLEDCord

Modified version of [LuckFire's AMOLEDCord](https://github.com/LuckFire/amoled-cord)
All I did was change the font to SF Pro Text

`Alright, alright, I get it. I'm an Apple meatrider.`

## Installation

- Vencord

> Go to themes and then paste the link to the **raw**`amoledcord.themes.css` file
